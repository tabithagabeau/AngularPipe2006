  An Observable is like a Promise, and is used to subscribe to information published to a stream
  All subscribers are "notified" when new information is available in the stream(network).
  The subscriber callback function is then invoked.

  Unlike Promises, Observables can be synchronous or asynchronous. They can provide 0 to many values.
  Promises can have only 1 activation, Observable can have 0 to 1 to many activations.
